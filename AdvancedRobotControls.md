# Controlling Advanced Robot Mechanisms

[Press here to return to main page.](https://github.com/iron-claw-972/Curriculum2020)

## 1. Purpose

This activity will introduce how to control several advanced robot mechanisms, namely:
- Pneumatics
- Reading Motor encoders
  - TalonSRX
  - TalonFX
  - CANSparkMax
- Encoders connected directly to the RoboRio

## 2. Materials

- FRC VS Code
  - Downloading FRC VS Code is detailed [here](https://github.com/iron-claw-972/Curriculum2020/blob/master/InstallingFrcPrereqs.md#frc-vscode).

## 3. Instructions

### Pneumatics

A piston, the main thing we use pneumatics for, is controlled by a solenoid. There are two kinds, Solenoid and DoubleSolenoid

The official WPI documentation for their DoubleSolenoid object is [here](https://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/DoubleSolenoid.html). 
The solenoid constructor needs to know the ports the
