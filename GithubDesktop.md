5. Enter the email address you used when creating your GitHub account and the password associated with it. Then left click on `Sign in`.

  - Note: In the event that you are already signed in to GitHub on your browser, you may press the `Sign in using your browser` link. This will open a webpage and will create a pop-up, to which you should select `Open GitHubDesktop.exe`. The webpage will close and you will be signed in.
  - Note: In the event that you forget your password, you can use the `Forgot Password?` dialog to recover your account.

At this point you should be signed in to GitHub Desktop.
